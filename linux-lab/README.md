## 🔥 What this repo is

This is my personal **Linux lab** while I level up from “just installed Ubuntu” to being comfortable using Linux at any company (dev, debugging, basic ops, a bit of security).  
You’ll find real notes, scripts, aliases and configurations I use while working on web, backend and mobile development.  

---

## 🧪 Current experiments

- Daily terminal workflows for:
  - Project navigation, file management, and quick search (find/grep/rg, fzf-style usage later).
  - Git from the command line (staging, branching, resolving conflicts).
- Setting up a comfortable Zsh environment:
  - Prompt tuned for path, git status and exit codes.
  - Handy aliases for lazy but efficient development.
- Practical Linux for developers:
  - Process monitoring (ps, top/htop).
  - Networking basics (curl, ping, netstat/ip).
  - Working with logs and systemctl services.

_As I learn, I keep this repo updated so you can literally follow the same path on your own machine._

## 📁 Structure (planned)

> This will grow as I add more content.

- `notes/` – Markdown notes for Linux basics, commands, and gotchas.
- `scripts/` – Small shell scripts I use to speed up daily tasks.
- `config/` – Selected config snippets (shell, editor, tools) that are safe to share.
- `cheatsheets/` – Quick-reference command lists and examples.

---

## 🧠 Skills I’m building with this repo

- Confident Linux usage for **software engineering**:
  - Navigating and managing files from the terminal.
  - Using git entirely 
# 🐧 Linux Lab – Manish’s Learning Roadmap

This repo follows a structured roadmap to learn Linux from beginner to advanced, with:

- concise notes (what each topic/command does)
- practical command exercises
- space for my own examples and mistakes

The structure mirrors a typical Linux learning path (file management, permissions, processes, networking, services, security, etc.).

> Goal: be comfortable using Linux as a developer and on real servers (plus some security/DevOps skills).
