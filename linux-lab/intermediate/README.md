# Intermediate – Working Like a Power User

Here I move beyond basics into topics useful for real servers and production:

1. Network configuration and troubleshooting  
2. Service management (systemd)  
3. Hardware inspection  
4. Backup automation  
5. Text & log processing  
6. Terminal multiplexing (screen/tmux)  
7. Basic security hardening

Goal: be able to configure and debug a typical Linux server or dev environment.
