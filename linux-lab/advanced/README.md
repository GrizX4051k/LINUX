# Advanced – Systems, Performance & Security

This section is for deeper systems work:

1. Kernel configuration and tuning  
2. System performance tracing and debugging  
3. Automation with Bash/Python + config management  
4. Filesystem internals and RAID/LVM  
5. Virtualization & containers  
6. Advanced security (SELinux/AppArmor, iptables, LUKS, etc.)

Goal: build enough depth to work comfortably with production systems or DevOps/SRE environments.
