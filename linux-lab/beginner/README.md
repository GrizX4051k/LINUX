# Beginner – Linux Fundamentals

Focus: get fully comfortable in the terminal.

Here I cover:

1. File management basics  
2. Filesystem & permissions  
3. System information & disk/memory usage  
4. User & group management  
5. Process management  
6. File archiving & transfer  
7. Package management on common distros

By the end of this section I should be able to use Linux daily without relying on a GUI for basic work.
