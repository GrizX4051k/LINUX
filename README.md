# 🐧 Linux – moved to a new lab

This repository is now a simple pointer.

👉 My active Linux learning and practice lives here:  
**[Linux Lab – structured notes & exercises](https://github.com/GrizX4051k/linux-lab)**

The new repo contains:

- Beginner → intermediate → advanced topics
- Notes and command references
- Practice exercises I actually run on my system
